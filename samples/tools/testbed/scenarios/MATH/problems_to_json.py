    "Tina the tourist goes on a trip. She starts at the origin and drives north (in the positive $y$ direction) for $10$ units. Then she turns east (the positive $x$ direction) and as she's turning her camera flies out the window and lands exactly at $(0,10)$. She then drives $9$ units east, turns and drives $8$ units north.  She continues this pattern of turning and driving one unit less than after the previous turn, until stopping after driving $1$ unit east. She reaches for her camera only to find it missing! She activates the GPS homing device on her camera and drives back to it in a straight line. What is the equation of this line?
