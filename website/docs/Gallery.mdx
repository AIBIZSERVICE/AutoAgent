## Contributing

To contribute, please open a PR that adds an entry to the `data/gallery.json` file in the `src` directory. The entry should be an object with the following properties:

```js
{
    "title": "AutoGen Playground",
    "link": "https://huggingface.co/spaces/thinkall/AutoGen_Playground",
    "description": "A space to explore the capabilities of AutoGen.",
    "image": "default.png",
    "tags": ["ui"]
  }
```

The `image` property should be the name of a file in the `static/img/gallery` directory.
The `tags` property should be an array of strings that describe the demo. We recommend using no more than two tags for clarity.
Here are the meanings of several tags for reference:
1. app: Using Autogen for specific applications.
2. extension: Enhancing AutoGen beyond the features in current version.
3. ui: Building user interface for AutoGen.
4. tool: Strengthening AutoGen Agents with external tools.
5. groupchat: Solving complex tasks with a group of Agents.

if the existing ones do not precisely portray your own demos, new tags are also encouraged to add.
