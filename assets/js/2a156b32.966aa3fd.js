It allows you to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Declaratively define and modify agents and multi-agent workflows through a point and click, drag and drop interface (e.g., you can select the parameters of two agents that will communicate to solve your task).\\r\\n- Use our UI to create chat sessions with the specified agents and view results (e.g., view chat history, generated files, and time taken).\\r\\n- Explicitly add skills to your agents and accomplish more tasks.\\r\\n- Publish your sessions to a local gallery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoGen Assistant is [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-assistant), give it a try!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accelerating pace of technology has ushered us into an era where digital assistants (or agents) are becoming integral to our lives. [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/autogen) has emerged as a leading framework for orchestrating the power of agents. In the spirit of expanding this frontier and democratizing this capability, we are thrilled to introduce a new user-friendly interface: the **AutoGen Assistant**. Built upon the leading foundation of AutoGen and robust, modern web technologies like React.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the AutoGen Assistant, users can rapidly create, manage, and interact with agents that can learn, adapt, and collaborate. As we release this interface into the open-source community, our ambition is not only to enhance productivity but to inspire a level of personalized interaction between humans and agents.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Getting Started with AutoGen Assistant\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following guide will help you get the AutoGen Assistant up and running on your system.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuring an LLM Provider\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you install AutoGen Assistant, you need access to a language model. You can get this set up by following the steps in the AutoGen documentation [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints). Configure your environment with either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, in your terminal, you would set the API key like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also specify the model directly in the agent\'s configuration as shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nllm_config = LLMConfig(\\r\\n    config_list=[{\\r\\n        \\"model\\": \\"gpt-4\\",\\r\\n        \\"api_key\\": \\"<azure_api_key>\\",\\r\\n        \\"a\\": \\"<azure apis base>\\",\\r\\n        \\"api_type\\": \\"azure\\",\\r\\n        \\"api_version\\": \\"2023-06-01-preview\\"\\r\\n    }],\\r\\n    temperature=0,\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installation\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Install from PyPi**\\r\\n\\r\\n   We recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., conda) to avoid conflicts with existing Python packages. With Python 3.10 or newer active in your virtual environment, use pip to install AutoGen Assistant:\\r\\n\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   pip install autogenra\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Install from Source**\\r\\n\\r\\n   > Note: This approach requires some familiarity with building interfaces in React.\\r\\n\\r\\n   If you prefer to install from source, ensure you have Python 3.10+ and Node.js (version above 14.15.0) installed. Here\'s how you get started:\\r\\n\\r\\n   - Clone the AutoGen Assistant repository and install its Python dependencies:\\r\\n\\r\\n     ```bash\\r\\n     pip install -e .\\r\\n     ```\\r\\n\\r\\n   - Navigate to the `samples/apps/autogen-assistant/frontend` directory, install dependencies, and build the UI:\\r\\n\\r\\n     ```bash\\r\\n     npm install -g gatsby-cli\\r\\n     npm install --global yarn\\r\\n     cd frontend\\r\\n     yarn install\\r\\n     yarn build\\r\\n     ```\\r\\n\\r\\n   For Windows users, to build the frontend, you may need alternative commands provided in the [autogen assistant readme](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-assistant).\\r\\n   For Windows users, to build the frontend, you may need alternative commands provided in the [AutoGen Assistant readme](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-assistant).\\r\\n### Running the Application\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce installed, run the web UI by entering the following in your terminal:\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nautogenra ui --port 8081\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will start the application on the specified port. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/` to begin using AutoGen Assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you have AutoGen Assistant installed and running, you are ready to explore its capabilities, including defining and modifying agent workflows, interacting with agents and sessions, and expanding agent skills.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Can You Do with the AutoGen Assistant?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AutoGen Assistant proposes some high-level concepts that help compose agents to solve tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Agent Workflow**: An agent workflow is a specification of a set of agents that can work together to accomplish a task. The simplest version of this is a setup with two agents \u2013 a user proxy agent (that represents a user i.e. it compiles code and prints result) and an assistant that can address task requests (e.g., generating plans, writing code, evaluating responses, proposing error recovery steps, etc.). A more complex flow could be a group chat where even more agents work towards a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Specify Agents.](img/autogenra_config.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Session**: A session refers to a period of continuous interaction or engagement with an agent workflow, typically characterized by a sequence of activities or operations aimed at achieving specific objectives. It includes the agent workflow configuration, the interactions between the user and the agents. A session can be \u201cpublished\u201d to a \u201cgallery\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Skills**: Skills are functions (e.g., Python functions) that describe how to solve a task. In general, a good skill has a descriptive name (e.g. `generate_images`), extensive docstrings and good defaults (e.g., writing out files to disk for persistence and reuse). You can add new skills to the AutoGen Assistant via the provided UI. At inference time, these skills are made available to the assistant agent as they address your tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutoGen Assistant comes with 3 example skills: `fetch_profile`, `find_papers`, `generate_images`. Please feel free to review the repo to learn more about how they work.\\r\\n\\r\\n![View and add skills.](img/autogenra_skills.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## The AutoGen Assistant API\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the AutoGen Assistant is a web interface, it is powered by an underlying python API that is reusable and modular. Importantly, we have implemented an API where agent workflows can be declaratively specified (in JSON), loaded and run. An example of the current API is shown below. Please consult the repo for latest updates.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport json\\r\\nfrom autogenra import AutoGenWorkFlowManager, FlowConfig\\r\\n\\r\\n# load an agent specification in JSON\\r\\nagent_spec = json.load(open(\'agent_spec.json\'))\\r\\n\\r\\n# Create an AutoGen Workflow Configuration from the agent specification\\r\\nagent_work_flow_config = FlowConfig(**agent_spec)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Create a Workflow from the configuration\\r\\nagent_work_flow = AutoGenWorkFlowManager(agent_work_flow_config)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Run the workflow on a task\\r\\ntask_query = \\"What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?\\"\\r\\nagent_work_flow.run(message=task_query)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Road Map and Next Steps\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we continue to develop and refine the AutoGen Assistant, the road map below outlines an array of enhancements and new features planned for future releases. Here\'s what users can look forward to:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Complex Agent Workflows**: We\'re working on integrating support for more sophisticated agent workflows, such as `GroupChat`, allowing for richer interaction between multiple agents or dynamic topologies.\\r\\n- **Improved User Experience**: This includes features like streaming intermediate model output for real-time feedback, better summarization of agent responses, information on costs of each interaction. We will also invest in improving the workflow for composing and reusing agents. We will also explore support for more interactive human in the loop feedback to agents.\\r\\n- **Expansion of Agent Skills**: We will work towards improving the workflow for authoring, composing and reusing agent skills.\\r\\n- **Community Features**: Facilitation of sharing and collaboration within the AutoGen Assistant user community is a key goal. We\'re exploring options for sharing sessions and results more easily among users and contributing to a shared repository of skills, agents, and agent workflows.\\r\\n\\r\\n## FAQs\\r\\n\\r\\n**Q: How can I add more skills to the AutoGen Assistant?**\\r\\nA: You can extend the capabilities of your agents by adding new Python functions. The AutoGen Assistant interface also lets you directly paste functions that can be reused in the agent workflow.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Q: Where can I adjust the agent configurations and settings?**\\r\\nA: You can modify agent configurations directly from the UI or by editing the default configurations in the `utils.py` file under the `get_default_agent_config()` method (assuming you are building your own UI).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Q: If I want to reset the conversation with an agent, how do I go about it?**\\r\\nA: To reset your conversation history, you can delete the `database.sqlite` file. If you need to clear user-specific data, remove the relevant `autogenra/web/files/user/<user_id_md5hash>` folder.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Q: Is it possible to view the output and messages generated by the agents during interactions?**\\r\\nA: Yes, you can view the generated messages in the debug console of the web UI, providing insights into the agent interactions. Alternatively, you can inspect the `database.sqlite` file for a comprehensive record of messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Q: Where can I find documentation and support for AutoGen Assistant?**\\r\\nA: Our GitHub repository hosts comprehensive documentation, including a detailed getting-started guide and an FAQ section. For additional support, you can raise issues on the repository or reach out to the community on forums and discussion boards associated with the project."},{"id":"Agent AutoBuild - Automatically Building Multi-agent Systems","metadata":{"permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/26/Agent-AutoBuild","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-26-Agent-AutoBuild/index.mdx","title":"Agent AutoBuild - Automatically Building Multi-agent Systems","description":"Overall structure of AutoBuild","date":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"LLM","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"research","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/research"}],"readingTime":6.715,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Linxin Song","title":"MS student at Waseda University","url":"https://linxins97.github.io/","imageURL":"https://github.com/LinxinS97.png","key":"LinxinS97"},{"name":"Jieyu Zhang","title":"PhD student at University of Washington","url":"https://jieyuz2.github.io/","imageURL":"https://github.com/jieyuz2.png","key":"jieyuz2"}],"prevItem":{"title":"AutoGen Assistant: Interactively Explore Multi-Agent Workflows","permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/12/01/AutoGenAssistant"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Assess Utility of LLM-powered Applications?","permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval"}},"content":"![Overall structure of AutoBuild](img/agent_autobuild.png)\\n\\n**TL;DR:**\\nIntroducing **AutoBuild**, building multi-agent system automatically, fast, and easily for complex tasks with minimal\\nuser prompt required, powered by a new designed class **AgentBuilder**. AgentBuilder also supports open-source LLMs by\\nleveraging [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).\\nCheckout example notebooks and source code for reference:\\n\\n- [AutoBuild Examples](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_autobuild.ipynb)\\n- [AgentBuilder](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/autogen/agentchat/contrib/agent_builder.py)\\n\\n## Introduction\\nIn this blog, we introduce **AutoBuild**, a pipeline that can automatically build multi-agent systems for complex tasks.\\nSpecifically, we design a new class called **AgentBuilder**, which will complete the generation of participant expert agents\\nand the construction of group chat automatically after the user provides descriptions of a building task and an execution task.\\n\\nAgentBuilder supports open-source models on Hugging Face powered by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html)\\nand [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Once the user chooses to use open-source LLM, AgentBuilder will set\\nup an endpoint server automatically without any user participation.\\n\\n## Installation\\n- AutoGen:\\n```bash\\npip install pyautogen~=0.2.0\\n```\\n- (Optional: if you want to use open-source LLMs) vLLM and FastChat\\n```bash\\npip install vllm fastchat\\n```\\n\\n## Basic Example\\nIn this section, we provide a step-by-step example of how to use AgentBuilder to build a multi-agent system for a specific task.\\n\\n### Step 1: prepare configurations\\nFirst, we need to prepare the Agent configurations.\\nSpecifically, a config path containing the model name and API key, and a default config for each agent, are required.\\n```python\\nconfig_path = \'/home/elpis_ubuntu/LLM/autogen/OAI_CONFIG_LIST\'  # modify path\\ndefault_llm_config = {\\n    \'temperature\': 0\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: create an AgentBuilder instance\\nThen, we create an AgentBuilder instance with the config path and default config.\\nYou can also specific the builder model and agent model, which are the LLMs used for building and agent respectively.\\n```python\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.agent_builder import AgentBuilder\\n\\nbuilder = AgentBuilder(config_path=config_path, builder_model=\'gpt-4-1106-preview\', agent_model=\'gpt-4-1106-preview\')\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: specify the building task\\nSpecify a building task with a general description. Building task will help the build manager (a LLM) decide what agents should be built.\\nNote that your building task should have a general description of the task. Adding some specific examples is better.\\n```python\\nbuilding_task = \\"Find a paper on arxiv by programming, and analyze its application in some domain. For example, find a latest paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: build group chat agents\\nUse `build()` to let the build manager (with a `builder_model` as backbone) complete the group chat agents generation.\\nIf you think coding is necessary for your task, you can use `coding=True` to add a user proxy (a local code interpreter) into the agent list as:\\n```python\\nagent_list, agent_configs = builder.build(building_task, default_llm_config, coding=True)\\n```\\nIf `coding` is not specified, AgentBuilder will determine on its own whether the user proxy should be added or not according to the task.\\nThe generated `agent_list` is a list of `AssistantAgent` instances.\\nIf `coding` is true, a user proxy (a `UserProxyAssistant` instance) will be added as the first element to the `agent_list`.\\n`agent_configs` is a list of agent configurations including agent name, backbone LLM model, and system message.\\nFor example\\n```\\n// an example of agent_configs. AgentBuilder will generate agents with the following configurations.\\n[\\n    {\\n        \\"name\\": \\"Data_scientist\\",\\n        \\"model\\": \\"gpt-4-1106-preview\\",\\n        \\"system_message\\": \\"As a Data Scientist, you are tasked with automating the retrieval and analysis of academic papers from arXiv. Utilize your Python programming acumen to develop scripts for gathering necessary information such as searching for relevant papers, downloading them, and processing their contents. Apply your analytical and language skills to interpret the data and deduce the applications of the research within specific domains.\\\\n\\\\n1. To compile information, write and implement Python scripts that search and interact with online resources, download and read files, extract content from documents, and perform other information-gathering tasks. Use the printed output as the foundation for your subsequent analysis.\\\\n\\\\n2. Execute tasks programmatically with Python scripts when possible, ensuring results are directly displayed. Approach each task with efficiency and strategic thinking.\\\\n\\\\nProgress through tasks systematically. In instances where a strategy is not provided, outline your plan before executing. Clearly distinguish between tasks handled via code and those utilizing your analytical expertise.\\\\n\\\\nWhen providing code, include only Python scripts meant to be run without user alterations. Users should execute your script as is, without modifications:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# filename: <filename>\\\\n# Python script\\\\nprint(\\\\\\"Your output\\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nUsers should not perform any actions other than running the scripts you provide. Avoid presenting partial or incomplete scripts that require user adjustments. Refrain from requesting users to copy-paste results; instead, use the \'print\' function when suitable to display outputs. Monitor the execution results they share.\\\\n\\\\nIf an error surfaces, supply corrected scripts for a re-run. If the strategy fails to resolve the issue, reassess your assumptions, gather additional details as needed, and explore alternative approaches.\\\\n\\\\nUpon successful completion of a task and verification of the results, confirm the achievement of the stated objective. Ensuring accuracy and validity of the findings is paramount. Evidence supporting your conclusions should be provided when feasible.\\\\n\\\\nUpon satisfying the user\'s needs and ensuring all tasks are finalized, conclude your assistance with \\\\\\"TERMINATE\\\\\\".\\"\\n    },\\n    ...\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: execute the task\\nLet agents generated in `build()` complete the task collaboratively in a group chat.\\n```python\\nimport autogen\\n\\ndef start_task(execution_task: str, agent_list: list, llm_config: dict):\\n    config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_path, filter_dict={\\"model\\": [\\"gpt-4-1106-preview\\"]})\\n\\n    group_chat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=agent_list, messages=[], max_round=12)\\n    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(\\n        groupchat=group_chat, llm_config={\\"config_list\\": config_list, **llm_config}\\n    )\\n    agent_list[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=execution_task)\\n\\nstart_task(\\n    execution_task=\\"Find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.\\",\\n    agent_list=agent_list,\\n    llm_config=default_llm_config\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 6 (Optional): clear all agents and prepare for the next task\\nYou can clear all agents generated in this task by the following code if your task is completed or if the next task is largely different from the current task.\\n```python\\nbuilder.clear_all_agents(recycle_endpoint=True)\\n```\\nIf the agent\'s backbone is an open-source LLM, this process will also shut down the endpoint server. More details are in the next section.\\nIf necessary, you can use `recycle_endpoint=False` to retain the previous open-source LLM\'s endpoint server.\\n\\n## Save and Load\\nYou can save all necessary information of the built group chat agents by\\n```python\\nsaved_path = builder.save()\\n```\\nConfigurations will be saved in JSON format with the following content:\\n```json\\n// FILENAME: save_config_TASK_MD5.json\\n{\\n    \\"building_task\\": \\"Find a paper on arxiv by programming, and analysis its application in some domain.

AgentBuilder will create agents with those information without prompting the build manager.\\n```python\\nnew_builder = AgentBuilder(config_path=config_path)\\nagent_list, agent_config = new_builder.load(saved_path)\\nstart_task(...)  # skip build()\\n```\\n\\n## Use Open-source LLM\\nAutoBuild supports open-source LLM by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).\\nCheck the supported model list [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).\\nAfter satisfying the requirements, you can add an open-source LLM\'s huggingface repository to the config file,\\n```json,\\n// Add the LLM\'s huggingface repo to your config file and use EMPTY as the api_key.\\n[\\n    ...\\n    {\\n        \\"model\\": \\"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\\",\\n        \\"api_key\\": \\"EMPTY\\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```\\nand specify it when initializing AgentBuilder.\\nAgentBuilder will automatically set up an endpoint server for open-source LLM. Make sure you have sufficient GPUs resources.\\n\\n## Use OpenAI Assistant\\n[Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications.\\nAn Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries.\\nAutoBuild also supports the assistant API by adding `use_oai_assistant=True` to `build()`.\\n```python\\n# Transfer to the OpenAI Assistant API.\\nagent_list, agent_config = new_builder.build(building_task, default_llm_config, use_oai_assistant=True)\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Future work/Roadmap\\n- Let the builder select the best agents from a given library/database to solve the task.\\n\\n## Summary\\nWe propose AutoBuild with a new class `AgentBuilder`.\\nAutoBuild can help user solve their complex task with an automatically built multi-agent system.\\nAutoBuild supports open-source LLMs and GPTs API, giving users more flexibility to choose their favorite models.\\nMore advanced features are coming soon."},{"id":"How to Assess Utility of LLM-powered Applications?","metadata":{"permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/20/AgentEval","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-20-AgentEval/index.mdx","title":"How to Assess Utility of LLM-powered Applications?","description":"Fig.1: A verification framework","date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"LLM","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"GPT","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/gpt"},{"label":"evaluation","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/evaluation"},{"label":"task utility","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/task-utility"}],"readingTime":9.48,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Julia Kiseleva","title":"Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research","url":"https://github.com/julianakiseleva/","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908392?v=4","key":"julianakiseleva"},{"name":"Negar Arabzadeh","title":"PhD student at the University of Waterloo","url":"https://www.negara.me/","imageURL":"https://github.com/Narabzad.png","key":"narabzad"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Agent AutoBuild - Automatically Building Multi-agent Systems","permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/26/Agent-AutoBuild"},"nextItem":{"title":"AutoGen Meets GPTs","permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/13/OAI-assistants"}},"content":"![Fig.1: A verification framework](img/agenteval-CQ.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"><em>Fig.1 illustrates the general flow of AgentEval</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n**TL;DR:**\\r\\n* As a developer of an LLM-powered application, how can you assess the utility it brings to end users while helping them with their tasks?\\r\\n* To shed light on the question above, we introduce `AgentEval` \u2014 the first version of the framework to assess the utility of any LLM-powered application crafted to assist users in specific tasks.  AgentEval aims to simplify the evaluation process by automatically proposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of your application. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the utility of your application against the suggested criteria.\\r\\n* We demonstrate how `AgentEval` work using [math problems dataset](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2023/06/28/MathChat) as an example in the [following notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agenteval_cq_math.ipynb). Any feedback would be useful for future development. Please contact us on our [Discord](http://aka.ms/autogen-dc).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction\\r\\n\\r\\n AutoGen aims to simplify the development of LLM-powered multi-agent systems for various applications, ultimately making end users\' lives easier by assisting with their tasks. Next, we all yearn to understand how our developed systems perform, their utility for users, and, perhaps most crucially, how we can enhance them. Directly evaluating multi-agent systems poses challenges as current approaches predominantly rely on success metrics \u2013 essentially, whether the agent accomplishes tasks. However, comprehending user interaction with a system involves far more than success alone. Take math problems, for instance; it\'s not merely about the agent solving the problem. Equally significant is its ability to convey solutions based on various criteria, including completeness, conciseness, and the clarity of the provided explanation. Furthermore, success isn\'t always clearly defined for every task.\\r\\n\\r\\n Rapid advances in LLMs and multi-agent systems have brought forth many emerging capabilities that we\'re keen on translating into tangible utilities for end users. We introduce the first version of `AgentEval` framework - a tool crafted to empower developers in swiftly gauging the utility of LLM-powered applications designed to help end users accomplish the desired task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![Fig.2: An overview of the tasks taxonomy](img/tasks-taxonomy.png)\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"><em>Fig. 2 provides  an overview of the tasks taxonomy</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s first look into an overview of the suggested task taxonomy that a multi-agent system can be designed for. In general, the tasks can be split into two types, where:\\r\\n* _Success is not clearly defined_ - refer to instances when users utilize a system in an assistive manner, seeking suggestions rather than expecting the system to solve the task. For example, a user might request the system to generate an email. In many cases, this generated content serves as a template that the user will later edit. However, defining success precisely for such tasks is relatively complex.\\r\\n* _Success is clearly defined_ - refer to instances where we can clearly define whether a system solved the task or not. Consider agents that assist in accomplishing household tasks, where the definition of success is clear and measurable. This category can be further divided into two separate subcategories:\\r\\n   * _The optimal solution exits_ - these are tasks where only one solution is possible. For example, if you ask your assistant to turn on the light, the success of this task is clearly defined, and there is only one way to accomplish it.\\r\\n   * _Multiple solutions exist_ - increasingly, we observe situations where multiple trajectories of agent behavior can lead to either success or failure. In such cases, it is crucial to differentiate between the various successful and unsuccessful trajectories. For example, when you ask the agent to suggest you a food recipe or tell you a joke.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our `AgentEval` framework, we are currently focusing on tasks where _Success is clearly defined_. Next, we will introduce the suggested framework.\\r\\n\\r\\n## `AgentEval` Framework\\r\\n\\r\\nOur previous research on [assistive agents in Minecraft](https://github.com/microsoft/iglu-datasets) suggested that the most optimal way to obtain human judgments is to present humans with two agents side by side and ask for preferences. In this setup of pairwise comparison, humans can develop criteria to explain why they prefer the behavior of one agent over another. For instance, _\'the first agent was faster in execution,\'_ or _\'the second agent moves more naturally.\'_ So, the comparative nature led humans to come up with a list of criteria that helps to infer the utility of the task. With this idea in mind, we designed `AgentEval` (shown in Fig. 1), where we employ LLMs to help us understand, verify, and assess task *utility* for the multi-agent system. Namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n* The goal of `CriticAgent` is to suggest the list of criteria (Fig. 1), that can be used to assess task utility. This is an example of how `CriticAgent` is defined using `Autogen`:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ncritic = autogen.AssistantAgent(\\r\\n    name=\\"critic\\",\\r\\n    llm_config={\\"config_list\\": config_list},\\r\\n    system_message=\\"\\"\\"You are a helpful assistant. You suggest criteria for evaluating different tasks. They should be distinguishable, quantifiable, and not redundant.\\r\\n    Convert the evaluation criteria into a dictionary where the keys are the criteria.\\r\\n    The value of each key is a dictionary as follows {\\"description\\": criteria description, \\"accepted_values\\": possible accepted inputs for this key}\\r\\n    Make sure the keys are criteria for assessing the given task. \\"accepted_values\\" include the acceptable inputs for each key that are fine-grained and preferably multi-graded levels. \\"description\\" includes the criterion description.\\r\\n    Return only the dictionary.\\"\\"\\"\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, the critic is given successful and failed examples of the task execution; then, it is able to return a list of criteria (Fig. 1). For reference, use the [following notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agenteval_cq_math.ipynb).\\r\\n\\r\\n* The goal of `QuantifierAgent` is to quantify each of the suggested criteria (Fig. 1), providing us with an idea of the utility of this system for the given task. Here is an example of how it can be defined:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nquantifier = autogen.AssistantAgent(\\r\\n    name=\\"quantifier\\",\\r\\n    llm_config={\\"config_list\\": config_list},\\r\\n    system_message = \\"\\"\\"You are a helpful assistant. You quantify the output of different tasks based on the given criteria.\\r\\n    The criterion is given in a dictionary format where each key is a distinct criteria.\\r\\n    The value of each key is a dictionary as follows {\\"description\\": criteria description , \\"accepted_values\\": possible accepted inputs for this key}\\r\\n    You are going to quantify each of the criteria for a given task based on the task description.\\r\\n    Return a dictionary where the keys are the criteria and the values are the assessed performance based on accepted values for each criteria.\\r\\n    Return only the dictionary.\\"\\"\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## `AgentEval` Results based on Math Problems Dataset\\r\\n\\r\\n As an example, after running CriticAgent, we obtained the following criteria to verify the results for math problem dataset:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Criteria      | Description | Accepted Values|\\r\\n|-----------|-----|----------------|\\r\\n| Problem Interpretation      | Ability to correctly interpret the problem  | [\\"completely off\\", \\"slightly relevant\\", \\"relevant\\", \\"mostly accurate\\", \\"completely accurate\\"]|\\r\\n| Mathematical Methodology      | Adequacy of the chosen mathematical or algorithmic methodology for the question  | [\\"inappropriate\\", \\"barely adequate\\", \\"adequate\\", \\"mostly effective\\", \\"completely effective\\"] |\\r\\n| Calculation Correctness       | Accuracy of calculations made and solutions given  |   [\\"completely incorrect\\", \\"mostly incorrect\\", \\"neither\\", \\"mostly correct\\", \\"completely correct\\"]     |\\r\\n| Explanation Clarity       | Clarity and comprehensibility of explanations, including language use and structure  | [\\"not at all clear\\", \\"slightly clear\\", \\"moderately clear\\", \\"very clear\\", \\"completely clear\\"] |\\r\\n| Code Efficiency       |  Quality of code in terms of efficiency and elegance |[\\"not at all efficient\\", \\"slightly efficient\\", \\"moderately efficient\\", \\"very efficient\\", \\"extremely efficient\\"] |\\r\\n| Code Correctness      | Correctness of the provided code  |  [\\"completely incorrect\\", \\"mostly incorrect\\", \\"partly correct\\", \\"mostly correct\\", \\"completely correct\\"]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, after running QuantifierAgent, we obtained the results presented in Fig. 3, where you can see three models:\\r\\n* AgentChat\\r\\n* ReAct\\r\\n* GPT-4 Vanilla Solver\\r\\n\\r\\nLighter colors represent estimates for failed cases, and brighter colors show how discovered criteria were quantified.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Fig.3: Results based on overall math problems dataset `_s` stands for successful cases, `_f` - stands for failed cases](img/math-problems-plot.png)\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"><em>Fig.3 presents results based on overall math problems dataset `_s` stands for successful cases, `_f` - stands for failed cases</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\nWe note that while applying agentEval to math problems, the agent was not exposed to any ground truth information about the problem. As such, this figure illustrates an estimated performance of the three different agents, namely, Autogen (blue), Gpt-4 (red), and ReAct (green). We observe that by comparing the performance of any of the three agents in successful cases (dark bars of any color) versus unsuccessful cases (lighter version of the same bar), we note that AgentEval was able to assign higher quantification to successful cases than that of failed ones. This observation verifies AgentEval\'s ability for task utility prediction. Additionally, AgentEval allows us to go beyond just a binary definition of success, enabling a more in-depth comparison between successful and failed cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s important not only to identify what is not working but also to recognize what and why actually went well.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Limitations and Future Work\\r\\nThe current implementation of `AgentEval` has a number of limitations which are planning to overcome in the future:\\r\\n* The list of criteria varies per run (unless you store a seed). We would recommend to run `CriticAgent` at least two times, and pick criteria you think is important for your domain.\\r\\n* The results of the `QuantifierAgent` can vary with each run, so we recommend conducting multiple runs to observe the extent of result variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo mitigate the limitations mentioned above, we are working on VerifierAgent, whose goal is to stabilize the results and provide additional explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\n`CriticAgent` and `QuantifierAgent` can be applied to the logs of any type of application, providing you with an in-depth understanding of the utility your solution brings to the user for a given task.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would love to hear about how AgentEval works for your application. Any feedback would be useful for future development.

|\\n| Weather | [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com) | What is the current cloud coverage in Mumbai, India? |\\n| Stock | [Alpha Vantage Stock API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) | Can you give me the opening price of Microsoft for the month of January 2023? |\\n\\n\\n### Leveraging external APIs\\n\\nTo address these queries, we first build a **two-agent system** based on AutoGen,\\nwhere the first agent is a **LLM assistant agent** (`AssistantAgent` in AutoGen) that is responsible for proposing and refining the code and\\nthe second agent is a **code executor agent** (`UserProxyAgent` in AutoGen) that would extract the generated code and execute it, forwarding the output back to the LLM assistant agent.\\nA visualization of the two-agent system is shown below.\\n\\n![chat](img/chat.png)\\n\\nTo instruct the assistant agent to leverage external APIs, we only need to add the API name/key dictionary at the beginning of the initial message.\\nThe template is shown below, where the red part is the information of APIs and black part is user query.\\n\\n![template](img/template.png)\\n\\nImportantly, we don\'t want to reveal our real API key to the assistant agent for safety concerns.\\nTherefore, we use a **fake API key** to replace the real API key in the initial message.\\nIn particular, we generate a random token (e.g., `181dbb37`) for each API key and replace the real API key with the token in the initial message.\\nThen, when the code executor execute the code, the fake API key would be automatically replaced by the real API key.\\n\\n\\n### Solution Demonstration\\nIn most practical scenarios, queries from users would appear sequentially over time.\\nOur **EcoAssistant** leverages past success to help the LLM assistants address future queries via **Solution Demonstration**.\\nSpecifically, whenever a query is deemed successfully resolved by user feedback, we capture and store the query and the final generated code snippet.\\nThese query-code pairs are saved in a specialized vector database. When new queries appear, **EcoAssistant** retrieves the most similar query from the database, which is then appended with the associated code to the initial prompt for the new query, serving as a demonstration.\\nThe new template of initial message is shown below, where the blue part corresponds to the solution demonstration.\\n\\n![template](img/template-demo.png)\\n\\nWe found that this utilization of past successful query-code pairs improves the query resolution process with fewer iterations and enhances the system\'s performance.\\n\\n\\n### Assistant Hierarchy\\nLLMs usually have different prices and performance, for example, GPT-3.5-turbo is much cheaper than GPT-4 but also less accurate.\\nThus, we propose the **Assistant Hierarchy** to reduce the cost of using LLMs.\\nThe core idea is that we use the cheaper LLMs first and only use the more expensive LLMs when necessary.\\nBy this way, we are able to reduce the reliance on expensive LLMs and thus reduce the cost.\\nIn particular, given multiple LLMs, we initiate one assistant agent for each and start the conversation with the most cost-effective LLM assistant.\\nIf the conversation between the current LLM assistant and the code executor concludes without successfully resolving the query, **EcoAssistant** would then restart the conversation with the next more expensive LLM assistant in the hierarchy.\\nWe found that this strategy significantly reduces costs while still effectively addressing queries.\\n\\n### A Synergistic Effect\\nWe found that the **Assistant Hierarchy** and **Solution Demonstration** of **EcoAssistant** have a synergistic effect.\\nBecause the query-code database is shared by all LLM assistants, even without specialized design,\\nthe solution from more powerful LLM assistant (e.g., GPT-4) could be later retrieved to guide weaker LLM assistant (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo).\\nSuch a synergistic effect further improves the performance and reduces the cost of **EcoAssistant**.\\n\\n### Experimental Results\\n\\nWe evaluate **EcoAssistant** on three datasets: Places, Weather, and Stock. When comparing it with a single GPT-4 assistant, we found that **EcoAssistant** achieves a higher success rate with a lower cost as shown in the figure below.\\nFor more details about the experimental results and other experiments, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03046).\\n\\n![exp](img/results.png)\\n\\n## Further reading\\n\\nPlease refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03046) and [codebase](https://github.com/JieyuZ2/EcoAssistant) for more details about **EcoAssistant**.\\n\\nIf you find this blog useful, please consider citing:\\n\\n```bibtex\\n@article{zhang2023ecoassistant,\\n  title={EcoAssistant: Using LLM Assistant More Affordably and Accurately},\\n  author={Zhang, Jieyu and Krishna, Ranjay and Awadallah, Ahmed H and Wang, Chi},\\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.03046},\\n  year={2023}\\n}\\n```"},{"id":"Multimodal with GPT-4V and LLaVA","metadata":{"permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/06/LMM-Agent","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-06-LMM-Agent/index.mdx","title":"Multimodal with GPT-4V and LLaVA","description":"LMM Teaser","date":"2023-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"LMM","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/lmm"},{"label":"multimodal","permalink":"/autogen/blog/tags/multimodal"}],"readingTime":2.03,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Beibin Li","title":"Senior Research Engineer at Microsoft","url":"https://github.com/beibinli","imageURL":"https://github.com/beibinli.png","key":"beibinli"}],"prevItem":{"title":"EcoAssistant - Using LLM Assistants More Accurately and Affordably","permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/11/09/EcoAssistant"},"nextItem":{"title":"AutoGen\'s TeachableAgent","permalink":"/autogen/blog/2023/10/26/TeachableAgent"}},"content":"![LMM Teaser](img/teaser.png)\\n\\n**In Brief:**\\n* Introducing the **Multimodal Conversable Agent** and the **LLaVA Agent** to enhance LMM functionalities.\\n* Users can input text and images simultaneously using the `<img img_path>` tag to specify image loading.\\n* Demonstrated through the [GPT-4V notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_lmm_gpt-4v.ipynb).\\n* Demonstrated through the [LLaVA notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_lmm_llava.ipynb).\\n\\n## Introduction\\nLarge multimodal models (LMMs) augment large language models (LLMs) with the ability to process multi-sensory data.\\n\\nThis blog post and the latest AutoGen update concentrate on visual comprehension. Users can input images, pose questions about them, and receive text-based responses from these LMMs.\\nWe support the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model from OpenAI and `LLaVA` model from Microsoft now.\\n\\nHere, we emphasize the **Multimodal Conversable Agent** and the **LLaVA Agent** due to their growing popularity.\\nGPT-4V represents the forefront in image comprehension, while LLaVA is an efficient model, fine-tuned from LLama-2.\\n\\n## Installation\\nIncorporate the `lmm` feature during AutoGen installation:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install \\"pyautogen[lmm]\\"\\n```\\n\\nSubsequently, import the **Multimodal Conversable Agent** or **LLaVA Agent** from AutoGen:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.multimodal_conversable_agent import MultimodalConversableAgent  # for GPT-4V\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.llava_agent import LLaVAAgent  # for LLaVA\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nA simple syntax has been defined to incorporate both messages and images within a single string.\\n\\nExample of an in-context learning prompt:\\n\\n```python\\nprompt = \\"\\"\\"You are now an image classifier for facial expressions.

But the assistant\'s memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. Then in subsequent chats the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.\\n\\n`TeachableAgent` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory implemented as a vector database. Memory is automatically saved to disk at the end of each chat, then loaded from disk at the start of the next. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it recall them in later chats.\\n\\nIn order to make effective decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `TeachableAgent` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` (another AutoGen agent) to identify and reformulate text as needed for remembering facts, preferences, and skills. Note that this adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens, which can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for each response.\\n\\n\\n## Run It Yourself\\n\\nAutoGen contains three code examples that use `TeachableAgent`.\\n\\n1. Run [chat_with_teachable_agent.py](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/agentchat/contrib/chat_with_teachable_agent.py) to converse with `TeachableAgent`.\\n\\n2.

The Vicuna model is a large-scale language model developed by Meta. It consists of 13 billion parameters, which is what makes it able to understand and generate human-like text across various topics. Parameters in a neural network are the weights and biases assigned to each connection between the neurons, and having more parameters enables the model to learn and capture more complex patterns and relationships in data. As an AI language model, Vicuna can be utilized in various language-related tasks, such as text completion, translation, summarization, and more.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nuser (to teachableagent):\\n\\nWhat is the Orca model?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nteachableagent (to user):\\n\\nThe Orca model is a yet-to-be-released language model by Meta, referring to the Research Preview API release of Meta\'s advanced language model. While I don\'t have specific details about the Orca model at this time, it is expected that the model would have an even larger number of parameters to further enhance its capabilities compared to its predecessor, Vicuna.\\n\\nAs AI language models evolve, they generally become more efficient at understanding and generating human-like text. This makes them more effective in completing a wide range of tasks, including text completion, translation, summarization, and Q&A, as well as providing more accurate and coherent results in various applications.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nuser (to teachableagent):\\n\\nOrca is a 13B-parameter language model released by Microsoft. It outperforms Vicuna on most tasks.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nteachableagent (to user):\\n\\nThank you for the clarification. Orca is a 13-billion-parameter language model developed by Microsoft. It is designed to outperform Vicuna, the language model released by Meta. With a large number of parameters, Orca is capable of understanding and generating human-like text across diverse subjects, making it highly useful in various applications.\\n\\nOrca\'s advanced capabilities allow it to excel in tasks such as text completion, translation, summarization, Q&A, and more. Its performance improvement over Vicuna highlights the rapid advancements in natural language processing (NLP) research and the development of increasingly capable AI language models.\\n```\\n\\nThen in a later chat the teachable agent can answer questions about the facts it has been taught.\\n(Remember to first close the previous chat by typing \'exit\'.)\\n```\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nuser (to teachableagent):\\n\\nHow does the Vicuna model compare to the Orca model?\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nteachableagent (to user):\\n\\nThe Vicuna and Orca models are both 13B-parameter language models released by Meta and Microsoft, respectively. In terms of performance, Orca has been reported to outperform Vicuna on most tasks. However, without detailed information about specific tasks and benchmarks, it is difficult to provide a more comprehensive comparison. Generally speaking, both models are advanced language models that aim to provide high-quality natural language understanding and generation, but Orca appears to have an edge in terms of overall performance.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Example 3 - Learning user preferences\\n\\nA user can teach the agent how they prefer to have things done.\\n\\nBe aware that a message like the next one cannot be entered as a single message through a command line because it contains a newline character.\\nSuch messages can be entered in a Jupyter notebook, or through some UI layer like that of ChatGPT.\\n```\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nuser (to teachableagent):\\n\\nPlease summarize this abstract.\\n\\nAutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation\\nQingyun Wu, Gagan Bansal, Jieyu Zhang, Yiran Wu, Beibin Li, Erkang Zhu, Li Jiang, Xiaoyun Zhang, Shaokun Zhang, Jiale Liu, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, Ryen W White, Doug Burger, Chi Wang\\nAutoGen is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish tasks.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google\'s PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4\'s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4\'s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nteachableagent (to user):\\n\\n- Title: Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4\\n- Innovation: GPT-4, an LLM with remarkable capabilities, demonstrates human-level performance across various domains, like math, coding, vision, medicine, law, and psychology.\\n- Key results: GPT-4 significantly surpasses prior models, suggesting it may be an early version of AGI; limitations and challenges toward deeper AGI are also discussed.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Example 4 - Learning new skills\\n\\nUsers can extend the teachable agent\'s capabilities by teaching it new skills for accomplishing challenging tasks.

In this blog post, we introduce RAG agents of\\nAutoGen that allows retrieval-augmented generation. The system consists of two agents: a\\nRetrieval-augmented User Proxy agent, called `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant\\nagent, called `RetrieveAssistantAgent`, both of which are extended from built-in agents from AutoGen.\\nThe overall architecture of the RAG agents is shown in the figure above.\\n\\nTo use Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented\\nUser Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy\\nnecessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented\\nUser Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute\\nembeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively\\nengage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:\\n1. The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding similarity,\\nand sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n2. The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based\\non the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it\\nis instructed to reply with \u201cUpdate Context\u201d to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.\\n3. If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and\\nsends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it\\nterminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along\\nwith the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation\\nis enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context\u201d, to the\\nRetrieval-Augmented Assistant.\\n4. If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives \u201cUpdate Context\u201d, it requests the next most similar\\nchunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it\\ngenerates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate\\nan answer, it replies with \u201cUpdate Context\u201d again. This process can be repeated several times.\\nThe conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context.\\n\\n## Basic Usage of RAG Agents\\n0. Install dependencies\\n\\nPlease install pyautogen with the [retrievechat] option before using RAG agents.\\n```bash\\npip install \\"pyautogen[retrievechat]\\"\\n```\\n\\nRetrieveChat can handle various types of documents.

The agents are customizable, conversable, and allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```\\n\\n4.

It is commonly used in fields such as software engineering, game development, and web development to speed up the development process and reduce errors. Autogen tools typically use pre-programmed rules, templates, and data to create code for repetitive tasks, such as generating user interfaces, database schemas, and data models. Some popular autogen tools include Visual Studio\'s Code Generator and Unity\'s Asset Store.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```\\n\\nYou can see that the output of `UserProxyAgent` is not related to our `autogen` since the latest info of\\n`autogen` is not in ChatGPT\'s training data. The output of `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` is correct as it can\\nperform retrieval-augmented generation based on the given documentation file.\\n\\n## Customizing RAG Agents\\n`RetrieveUserProxyAgent` is customizable with `retrieve_config`. There are several parameters to configure\\nbased on different use cases. In this section, we\'ll show how to customize embedding function, text split\\nfunction and vector database.\\n\\n### Customizing Embedding Function\\nBy default, [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net) and its pretrained models will be used to\\ncompute embeddings. It\'s possible that you want to use OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace or other embedding functions.\\n\\n* OpenAI\\n```python\\nfrom chromadb.utils import embedding_functions\\n\\nopenai_ef = embedding_functions.OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(\\n                api_key=\\"YOUR_API_KEY\\",\\n                model_name=\\"text-embedding-ada-002\\"\\n            )\\n\\nragproxyagent = RetrieveUserProxyAgent(\\n    name=\\"ragproxyagent\\",\\n    retrieve_config={\\n        \\"task\\": \\"qa\\",\\n        \\"docs_path\\": \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/autogen/main/README.md\\",\\n        \\"embedding_function\\": openai_ef,\\n    },\\n)\\n```\\n\\n* HuggingFace\\n```python\\nhuggingface_ef = embedding_functions.HuggingFaceEmbeddingFunction(\\n    api_key=\\"YOUR_API_KEY\\",\\n    model_name=\\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\\"\\n)\\n```\\n\\nMore examples can be found [here](https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings).\\n\\n### Customizing Text Split Function\\nBefore we can store the documents into a vector database, we need to split the texts into chunks. Although\\nwe have implemented a flexible text splitter in autogen, you may still want to use different text splitters.\\nThere are also some existing text split tools which are good to reuse.\\n\\nFor example, you can use all the text splitters in langchain.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\nrecur_spliter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(separators=[\\"\\\\n\\", \\"\\\\r\\", \\"\\\\t\\"])\\n\\nragproxyagent = RetrieveUserProxyAgent(\\n    name=\\"ragproxyagent\\",\\n    retrieve_config={\\n        \\"task\\": \\"qa\\",\\n        \\"docs_path\\": \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/autogen/main/README.md\\",\\n        \\"custom_text_split_function\\": recur_spliter.split_text,\\n    },\\n)\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Customizing Vector Database\\nWe are using chromadb as the default vector database, you can also replace it with any other vector database\\nby simply overriding the function `retrieve_docs` of `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`.\\n\\nFor example, you can use Qdrant as below:\\n\\n```python\\n# Creating qdrant client\\nfrom qdrant_client import QdrantClient\\n\\nclient = QdrantClient(url=\\"***\\", api_key=\\"***\\")\\n\\n# Wrapping RetrieveUserProxyAgent\\nfrom litellm import embedding as test_embedding\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.retrieve_user_proxy_agent import RetrieveUserProxyAgent\\nfrom qdrant_client.models import SearchRequest, Filter, FieldCondition, MatchText\\n\\nclass QdrantRetrieveUserProxyAgent(RetrieveUserProxyAgent):\\n    def query_vector_db(\\n        self,\\n        query_texts: List[str],\\n        n_results: int = 10,\\n        search_string: str = \\"\\",\\n        **kwargs,\\n    ) -> Dict[str, Union[List[str], List[List[str]]]]:\\n        # define your own query function here\\n        embed_response = test_embedding(\'text-embedding-ada-002\', input=query_texts)\\n\\n        all_embeddings: List[List[float]] = []\\n\\n        for item in embed_response[\'data\']:\\n            all_embeddings.append(item[\'embedding\'])\\n\\n        search_queries: List[SearchRequest] = []\\n\\n        for embedding in all_embeddings:\\n            search_queries.append(\\n                SearchRequest(\\n                    vector=embedding,\\n                    filter=Filter(\\n                        must=[\\n                            FieldCondition(\\n                                key=\\"page_content\\",\\n                                match=MatchText(\\n                                    text=search_string,\\n                                )\\n                            )\\n                        ]\\n                    ),\\n                    limit=n_results,\\n                    with_payload=True,\\n                )\\n            )\\n\\n        search_response = client.search_batch(\\n            collection_name=\\"{your collection name}\\",\\n            requests=search_queries,\\n        )\\n\\n        return {\\n            \\"ids\\": [[scored_point.id for scored_point in batch] for batch in search_response],\\n            \\"documents\\": [[scored_point.payload.get(\'page_content\', \'\') for scored_point in batch] for batch in search_response],\\n            \\"metadatas\\": [[scored_point.payload.get(\'metadata\', {}) for scored_point in batch] for batch in search_response]\\n        }\\n\\n    def retrieve_docs(self, problem: str, n_results: int = 20, search_string: str = \\"\\", **kwargs):\\n        results = self.query_vector_db(\\n            query_texts=[problem],\\n            n_results=n_results,\\n            search_string=search_string,\\n            **kwargs,\\n        )\\n\\n        self._results = results\\n\\n\\n# Use QdrantRetrieveUserProxyAgent\\nqdrantragagent = QdrantRetrieveUserProxyAgent(\\n    name=\\"ragproxyagent\\",\\n    human_input_mode=\\"NEVER\\",\\n    max_consecutive_auto_reply=2,\\n    retrieve_config={\\n        \\"task\\": \\"qa\\",\\n    },\\n)\\n\\nqdrantragagent.retrieve_docs(\\"What is Autogen?\\", n_results=10, search_string=\\"autogen\\")\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced Usage of RAG Agents\\n### Integrate with other agents in a group chat\\nTo use `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` in a group chat is almost the same as you use it in a two agents chat. The only thing is that\\nyou need to **initialize the chat with `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`**. The `RetrieveAssistantAgent` is not necessary in a group chat.\\n\\nHowever, you may want to initialize the chat with another agent in some cases.

The improvement was especially notable in the Algebra category, with a 15% increase in accuracy.**\\n* **Despite the advancement, GPT-4 still struggles to solve very challenging math problems, even with effective prompting strategies. Further improvements are needed, such as the development of more specific assistant models or the integration of new tools and prompts.**\\n\\nRecent Large Language Models (LLMs) like GTP-3.5 and GPT-4 have demonstrated astonishing abilities over previous models on various tasks, such as text generation, question answering, and code generation. Moreover, these models can communicate with humans through conversations and remember previous contexts, making it easier for humans to interact with them. These models play an increasingly important role in our daily lives assisting people with different tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing documents, and writing code.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we probe into the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we are interested in their capabilities to solve advanced math problems, which could be representative of a broader class of problems that require precise reasoning and also have deterministic solutions.\\n\\nWe introduce MathChat, a conversational framework designed for solving challenging math problems with LLMs. This framework takes advantage of the chat-optimized feature of state-of-the-art LLMs, where a user proxy agent and an LLM assistant work together to tackle math problems. We also test previous prompting techniques for comparison.\\n\\n## The MathChat Framework\\n\\nMathChat simulates a conversation between the LLM assistant and a user proxy agent. As the name indicates, the user proxy agent acts as a proxy for the user, which is responsible for communicating with the LLM assistant and continuing the conversation in a desired manner.\\n\\nThe proxy agent first presents a math problem to the LLM assistant, framed by an initial prompt that guides the assistant in how it should work collaboratively to solve the problem. We incorporate existing prompting methods such as CoT (chain-of-thought) and tool-using are incorporated in the initial prompt. Key components of the prompt include:\\n\\n- **Tool-using Prompt:** This guides the LLM assistant to use Python code in the correct format to address the problem, allowing the user proxy agent to parse the code and provide the appropriate results.\\n\\n- **Problem-Solving Strategy Selection Prompt:** The assistant is instructed to choose one of three potential problem-solving strategies, including:\\n  1. Writing a Python program to solve the problem directly.\\n  2. Solving the problem directly without using Python, which exercises LLMs\' inherent reasoning capabilities.\\n  3. Solving the problem step by step with Python. This should be used when the first two strategies aren\'t suitable.\\n\\n- **Final Answer Encapsulation Prompt:** This part instructs the assistant to put the final answer in *\\\\boxed*{}.\\n\\nThe prompt design in MathChat is flexible and can easily be refined to include other tools, such as Wolfram Alpha.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at an example between the **User Proxy Agent** and the **LLM Assistant** (GPT-4). The conversation focuses on how to solve inequality using Python.\\n(The conversation is modified for readability.)\\n\\n| Participant | Dialogue |\\n|-------------|----------|\\n| User Proxy Agent | (Initial Prompt: Let\'s solve a math problem with Python...) Problem: Find all x that satisfy the inequality (2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8). Express your answer in interval notation. |\\n| LLM assistant | The key idea to solve this problem is to find the critical points, which are the points where the inequality is equal. Then, test the intervals between the critical points to find the interval for which the inequality holds. |\\n| LLM assistant (continued) | Here\'s Python code to find the critical points: `from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve; x = symbols(\\"x\\"); lhs = (2*x + 10)*(x + 3); rhs = (3*x + 9)*(x + 8); equation = Eq(lhs, rhs); critical_points = solve(equation, x); critical_points` |\\n| User Proxy Agent | The critical points are: [-14, -3] |\\n| LLM assistant | We found the critical points to be x = -14 and x = -3. Now we\'ll test the intervals between these critical points as well as points before and after the critical points. The intervals are: x < -14, -14 < x < -3, x > -3. |\\n| LLM assistant (continued) | Here\'s Python code to test the inequality for each interval: `from sympy import symbols; x = symbols(\\"x\\"); inequality = (2*x + 10)*(x + 3) < (3*x + 9)*(x + 8); test_points = [-15, -5, 0]; intervals = []; for point in test_points: if inequality.subs(x, point): intervals.append(point); intervals` |\\n| User Proxy Agent | The intervals where the inequality holds true are for test points: [-15, 0] |\\n| LLM assistant | We have tested the intervals and found that the inequality holds for: 1. x < -14 (test point: -15) 2. x > -3 (test point: 0). Therefore, the solution to the inequality (2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8) is x \u2208 (-\u221e, -14) \u222a (-3, \u221e) |\\n\\n## Experiment Setup\\n\\nWe evaluate the improvement brought by MathChat.\\n\\nFor the experiment, we focus on the level-5 problems from the MATH dataset, which are composed of high school competition problems. These problems include the application of theorems and complex equation derivation and are challenging even for undergraduate students. We evaluate 6 of 7 categories from the dataset (excluding Geometry): Prealgebra, Algebra, Number Theory, Counting and Probability, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus.\\n\\nWe evaluate GPT-4 and use the default configuration of the OpenAI API. To access the final performance, we manually compare the final answer with the correct answer.  For the vanilla prompt, Program Synthesis, and MathChat, we have GPT-4 enclose the final answer in *\\\\boxed*{}, and we take the return of the function in PoT as the final answer.\\n\\n\\nWe also evaluate the following methods for comparison:\\n\\n1. **Vanilla prompting:** Evaluates GPT-4\'s direct problem-solving capability. The prompt used is: *\\" Solve the problem carefully. Put the final answer in \\\\boxed{}\\"*.\\n\\n2. **Program of Thoughts (PoT):** Uses a zero-shot PoT prompt that requests the model to create a *Solver* function to solve the problem and return the final answer.\\n\\n3. **Program Synthesis (PS) prompting:** Like PoT, it prompts the model to write a program to solve the problem. The prompt used is: *\\"Write a program that answers the following question: \\\\{Problem\\\\}\\"*.\\n\\n## Experiment Results\\n\\nThe accuracy on all the problems with difficulty level-5 from different categories of the MATH dataset with different methods is shown below:\\n\\n![Result](img/result.png)\\n\\nWe found that compared to basic prompting, which demonstrates the innate capabilities of GPT-4, utilizing Python within the context of PoT or PS strategy improved the overall accuracy by about 10%. This increase was mostly seen in categories involving more numerical manipulations, such as Counting & Probability and Number Theory, and in more complex categories like Intermediate Algebra and Precalculus.\\n\\nFor categories like Algebra and Prealgebra, PoT and PS showed little improvement, and in some instances, even led to a decrease in accuracy. However, MathChat was able to enhance total accuracy by around 6% compared to PoT and PS, showing competitive performance across all categories. Remarkably, MathChat improved accuracy in the Algebra category by about 15% over other methods. Note that categories like Intermediate Algebra and Precalculus remained challenging for all methods, with only about 20% of problems solved accurately.\\n\\nThe code for experiments can be found at this [repository](https://github.com/kevin666aa/FLAML/tree/gpt_math_solver/flaml/autogen/math).\\nWe now provide an implementation of MathChat using the interactive agents in AutoGen. See this [notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_MathChat.ipynb) for example usage.\\n\\n## Future Directions\\n\\nDespite MathChat\'s improvements over previous methods, the results show that complex math problem is still challenging for recent powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, even with help from external tools.\\n\\nFurther work can be done to enhance this framework or math problem-solving in general:\\n- Although enabling the model to use tools like Python can reduce calculation errors, LLMs are still prone to logic errors. Methods like self-consistency (Sample several solutions and take a major vote on the final answer), or self-verification (use another LLM instance to check whether an answer is correct) might improve the performance.\\n- Sometimes, whether the LLM can solve the problem depends on the plan it uses. Some plans require less computation and logical reasoning, leaving less room for mistakes.\\n- MathChat has the potential to be adapted into a copilot system, which could assist users with math problems. This system could allow users to be more involved in the problem-solving process, potentially enhancing learning.\\n\\n## For Further Reading\\n\\n* [Research paper of MathChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337)\\n* [Documentation about `autogen`](/docs/Getting-Started)\\n\\n*Are you working on applications that involve math problem-solving?

On a code completion benchmark, [HumanEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval), developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 can successfully solve 68% tasks while GPT-3.5-Turbo does 46%. It is possible to increase the success rate of GPT-4 further by generating multiple responses or making multiple calls. However, that will further increase the cost, which is already nearly 20 times of using GPT-3.5-Turbo and with more restricted API call rate limit. Can we achieve more with less?\\n\\nIn this blog post, we will explore a creative, adaptive way of using GPT models which leads to a big leap forward.\\n\\n## Observations\\n\\n* GPT-3.5-Turbo can already solve 40%-50% tasks. For these tasks if we never use GPT-4, we can save nearly 40-50% cost.\\n* If we use the saved cost to generate more responses with GPT-4 for the remaining unsolved tasks, it is possible to solve some more of them while keeping the amortized cost down.\\n\\nThe obstacle of leveraging these observations is that we do not know *a priori* which tasks can be solved by the cheaper model, which tasks can be solved by the expensive model, and which tasks can be solved by paying even more to the expensive model.\\n\\nTo overcome that obstacle, one may want to predict which task requires what model to solve and how many responses are required for each task. Let\'s look at one example code completion task:\\n\\n```python\\ndef vowels_count(s):\\n    \\"\\"\\"Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing\\n    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.\\n    Vowels in this case are \'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\'. Here, \'y\' is also a\\n    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.\\n\\n    Example:\\n    >>> vowels_count(\\"abcde\\")\\n    2\\n    >>> vowels_count(\\"ACEDY\\")\\n    3\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nCan we predict whether GPT-3.5-Turbo can solve this task or do we need to use GPT-4? My first guess is that GPT-3.5-Turbo can get it right because the instruction is fairly straightforward. Yet, it turns out that GPT-3.5-Turbo does not consistently get it right, if we only give it one chance. It\'s not obvious (but an interesting research question!) how to predict the performance without actually trying.\\n\\nWhat else can we do? We notice that:\\n**It\'s \\"easier\\" to verify a given solution than finding a correct solution from scratch.**\\n\\nSome simple example test cases are provided in the docstr. If we already have a response generated by a model, we can use those test cases to filter wrong implementations, and either use a more powerful model or generate more responses, until the result passes the example test cases. Moreover, this step can be automated by asking GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate assertion statements from the examples given in the docstr (a simpler task where we can place our bet) and executing the code.\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\nCombining these observations, we can design a solution with two intuitive ideas:\\n\\n* Make use of auto-generated feedback, i.e., code execution results, to filter responses.\\n* Try inference configurations one by one, until one response can pass the filter.\\n\\n![Design](img/design.png)\\n\\nThis solution works adaptively without knowing or predicting which task fits which configuration. It simply tries multiple configurations one by one, starting from the cheapest configuration. Note that one configuration can generate multiple responses (by setting the inference parameter n larger than 1). And different configurations can use the same model and different inference parameters such as n and temperature. Only one response is returned and evaluated per task.\\n\\nAn implementation of this solution is provided in [autogen](/docs/reference/code_utils#implement). It uses the following sequence of configurations:\\n\\n1. GPT-3.5-Turbo, n=1, temperature=0\\n1. GPT-3.5-Turbo, n=7, temperature=1, stop=[\\"\\\\nclass\\", \\"\\\\ndef\\", \\"\\\\nif\\", \\"\\\\nprint\\"]\\n1. GPT-4, n=1, temperature=0\\n1. GPT-4, n=2, temperature=1, stop=[\\"\\\\nclass\\", \\"\\\\ndef\\", \\"\\\\nif\\", \\"\\\\nprint\\"]\\n1. GPT-4, n=1, temperature=1, stop=[\\"\\\\nclass\\", \\"\\\\ndef\\", \\"\\\\nif\\", \\"\\\\nprint\\"]\\n\\n## Experiment Results\\n\\nThe first figure in this blog post shows the success rate and average inference cost of the adaptive solution compared with default GPT-4.\\nThe inference cost includes the cost for generating the assertions in our solution. The generated assertions are not always correct, and programs that pass/fail the generated assertions are not always right/wrong. Despite of that, the adaptive solution can increase the success rate (referred to as pass@1 in the literature) from 68% to 90%, while reducing the cost by 18%.\\n\\nHere are a few examples of function definitions which are solved by different configurations in the portfolio.\\n\\n1. Solved by GPT-3.5-Turbo, n=1, temperature=0\\n```python\\ndef compare(game,guess):\\n    \\"\\"\\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\\n    event is finally known.

If they have guessed correctly,\\n    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\\n\\n\\n    example:\\n\\n    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]\\n    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n```\\n2.

It misleads the adaptive solution because a correct implementation is regarded as wrong and more trials are made. The last configuration in the sequence returns the right implementation, even though it does not pass the auto-generated assertions. This example demonstrates that:\\n* Our adaptive solution has a certain degree of fault tolerance.\\n* The success rate and inference cost for the adaptive solution can be further improved if correct example test cases are used.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the reduced inference cost is the amortized cost over all the tasks. For each individual task, the cost can be either larger or smaller than directly using GPT-4. This is the nature of the adaptive solution: The cost is in general larger for difficult tasks than that for easy tasks.\\n\\nAn example notebook to run this experiment can be found at: https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/v1.2.1/notebook/research/autogen_code.ipynb.

For hard problems, the tuned gpt-4 is much more accurate (e.g., 35% vs. 20%) and less expensive than untuned gpt-4.**\\n* **AutoGen can help with model selection, parameter tuning, and cost-saving in LLM applications.**\\n\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that can generate natural language texts for various applications, such as chatbots, summarization, translation, and more. GPT-4 is currently the state of the art LLM in the world. Is model selection irrelevant? What about inference parameters?\\n\\nIn this blog post, we will explore how model and inference parameter matter in LLM applications, using a case study for [MATH](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/be83ab3ecd0db773eb2dc1b0a17836a1-Abstract-round2.html), a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on advanced mathematical problem solving. MATH consists of 12K math competition problems from AMC-10, AMC-12 and AIME. Each problem is accompanied by a step-by-step solution.\\n\\nWe will use AutoGen to automatically find the best model and inference parameter for LLMs on a given task and dataset given an inference budget, using a novel low-cost search & pruning strategy. AutoGen currently supports all the LLMs from OpenAI, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\\n\\nWe will use AutoGen to perform model selection and inference parameter tuning. Then we compare the performance and inference cost on solving algebra problems with the untuned gpt-4. We will also analyze how different difficulty levels affect the results.\\n\\n## Experiment Setup\\n\\nWe use AutoGen to select between the following models with a target inference budget $0.02 per instance:\\n- gpt-3.5-turbo, a relatively cheap model that powers the popular ChatGPT app\\n- gpt-4, the state of the art LLM that costs more than 10 times of gpt-3.5-turbo\\n\\nWe adapt the models using 20 examples in the train set, using the problem statement as the input and generating the solution as the output. We use the following inference parameters:\\n\\n- temperature: The parameter that controls the randomness of the output text. A higher temperature means more diversity but less coherence. We search for the optimal temperature in the range of [0, 1].\\n- top_p: The parameter that controls the probability mass of the output tokens. Only tokens with a cumulative probability less than or equal to top-p are considered. A lower top-p means more diversity but less coherence. We search for the optimal top-p in the range of [0, 1].\\n- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated for each output. We search for the optimal max length in the range of [50, 1000].\\n- n: The number of responses to generate. We search for the optimal n in the range of [1, 100].\\n- prompt: We use the template: \\"{problem} Solve the problem carefully. Simplify your answer as much as possible. Put the final answer in \\\\\\\\boxed{{}}.\\" where {problem} will be replaced by the math problem instance.\\n\\nIn this experiment, when n > 1, we find the answer with highest votes among all the responses and then select it as the final answer to compare with the ground truth. For example, if n = 5 and 3 of the responses contain a final answer 301 while 2 of the responses contain a final answer 159, we choose 301 as the final answer. This can help with resolving potential errors due to randomness. We use the average accuracy and average inference cost as the metric to evaluate the performance over a dataset. The inference cost of a particular instance is measured by the price per 1K tokens and the number of tokens consumed.\\n\\n## Experiment Results\\n\\nThe first figure in this blog post shows the average accuracy and average inference cost of each configuration on the level 2 Algebra test set.\\n\\nSurprisingly, the tuned gpt-3.5-turbo model is selected as a better model and it vastly outperforms untuned gpt-4 in accuracy (92% vs. 70%) with equal or 2.5 times higher inference budget.\\nThe same observation can be obtained on the level 3 Algebra test set.\\n\\n![level 3 algebra](img/level3algebra.png)\\n\\nHowever, the selected model changes on level 4 Algebra.\\n\\n![level 4 algebra](img/level4algebra.png)\\n\\nThis time gpt-4 is selected as the best model. The tuned gpt-4 achieves much higher accuracy (56% vs. 44%) and lower cost than the untuned gpt-4.\\nOn level 5 the result is similar.\\n\\n![level 5 algebra](img/level5algebra.png)\\n\\nWe can see that AutoGen has found different optimal model and inference parameters for each subset of a particular level, which shows that these parameters matter in cost-sensitive LLM applications and need to be carefully tuned or adapted.\\n\\nAn example notebook to run these experiments can be found at: https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/v1.2.1/notebook/autogen_chatgpt.ipynb. The experiments were run when AutoGen was a subpackage in FLAML.\\n\\n## Analysis and Discussion\\n\\nWhile gpt-3.5-turbo demonstrates competitive accuracy with voted answers in relatively easy algebra problems under the same inference budget, gpt-4 is a better choice for the most difficult problems. In general, through parameter tuning and model selection, we can identify the opportunity to save the expensive model for more challenging tasks, and improve the overall effectiveness of a budget-constrained system.\\n\\nThere are many other alternative ways of solving math problems, which we have not covered in this blog post. When there are choices beyond the inference parameters, they can be generally tuned via [`flaml.tune`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).\\n\\nThe need for model selection, parameter tuning and cost saving is not specific to the math problems. The [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) project is an example where high cost can easily prevent a generic complex task to be accomplished as it needs many LLM inference calls.\\n\\n## For Further Reading\\n\\n* [Research paper about the tuning technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673)\\n* [Documentation about inference tuning](/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference)\\n\\n*Do you have any experience to share about LLM applications?
